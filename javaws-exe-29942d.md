Javaws.exe is a process that belongs to the Java Web Start technology, which allows users to launch Java applications directly from the internet using a web browser. This executable file is responsible for managing the download and execution of Java applets or applications in a secure sandbox environment, providing a convenient way for users to run Java programs without the need for manual installation. Javaws.exe facilitates the automatic updating of Java applications and ensures that they run smoothly and securely within the Java Runtime Environment.
